# Typography Notes

## Terminology
### The Anatomy of a Typeface
`Ascender`: The portion of a letter that extends above the mean line of a font -- i.e., is taller than the font's x-height. (In this case, you will also notice the letter ‘h’ is taller than the x-height.)

`Baseline`: The line where the letters sit.

`Bowl`: The curved part of the character that encloses the circular or curved parts of some letters, like ‘d’, ‘b’, ‘o’, ‘d’, and ‘b’. (In the case, it is that round shape sticking off the letter ‘a’.)

`Cap height`: The distance from the baseline to the top of the capital letter.

`Cross` bar: The bar that goes across the inside of the letter and connects one side to another. (In this case, it is the bar inside the capital letter 'B’.)

`Counter`: The empty space in the middle of letters such as ‘B’, ‘O’, or ‘A’.

`Descender`: The longest point on a letter that falls beyond the baseline.

`Finial`: The tapered end of letters such as ‘e’ or ‘c’.

`Ligature`: The stroke that joins adjacent letters.

`Serif`: The slight projection finishing off a stroke of a letter in certain typefaces. (In this case, it is that little foot sticking off the letter ‘l’.)

`Spine`: The curvy body of the letter 's' -- and only the letter ’s’. It gets its own term because the spine can be almost vertical or mostly horizontal, depending on the typeface.

`Stem`: The base of a letter, like the stem of a flower.

`Terminal`: A type of curve that you see at the top of the letter ‘f’ or the end of the letter ‘j’.

`X-height`: Located in between the baseline and the cap height, it is the height of the body of the lowercase letter. (In this case, it is the letters ‘a’, ’u’, and ‘y’.)
